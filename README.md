Generate Optionalneeds and Basicneeds related Items

Since a former development friend named Stoned0001 also on this plattform started leaking my scripts, I decided to upload them by myself

You can stack effects, define a notification and the used prop. The Animation will always be related to the first effect ("Art") you put in there

Example for usage:

beer = {Art= {"drunk", "hunger", "thirst"},menge = 20000, notification= 'Du hast dir ein frisch gezapftes Bier geg√∂nnt', prop_name = "lrz_tennets"};
